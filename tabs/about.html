    Hi, I’m Katherine! I’m driven by a passion for AI, robotics, and building solutions that bridge the digital and physical worlds. I began my college journey in Business Analytics at Purdue, but my love of hands-on creation led me to transfer into Computer Engineering. Since then, I’ve founded the ML@P Accelerator Program, contributed to cutting-edge research, and competed in hackathons and case competitions. When I’m not deep in coursework or a personal project, you’ll find me tinkering with arts & crafts, playing Minecraft, reading, or investigating a new potential hobby. A random fun fact: I have two corgis!

    I built this portfolio to share some of my favorite projects and experiences—from designing games to running 700+ simulations on Purdue’s supercomputer. Feel free to explore, and if you have any questions or just want to say hello, head over to the Contact tab and drop me a message!
