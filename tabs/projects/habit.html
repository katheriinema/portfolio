  <h2>Description</h2>

    I know, I know—a habit tracker is one of the most standardized starting projects out there. But I wanted to take the idea and gamify it for the new year of 2025. We are a quarter of the way to a new century! So let's actually stick to our New Year goals through a habit tracker. But the only way I can motivate myself is if there are cute things involved. So I wanted to create a habit tracker that rewards you with dogs.
