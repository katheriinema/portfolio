  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
      In this cozy simulation game, users manage a colony of penguins. This project challenged me both technically and creatively—designing mechanics in Godot, coding in GDScript, and crafting art assets. Activities include fishing, building structures, and collecting new penguin species.
