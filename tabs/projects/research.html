  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Main contribution was writing script to simulate and analyze data to evaluate air quality. The project involved using Python and R to sort and process a vast quantity of air quality data. This data is then ran through 700+ simulations to determine change in air particles over time which is then analyzed to identify trends and patterns. The goal was to provide insights into the factors affecting air quality and to inform policy decisions. Presented at Purdue Undergraduate Spring Research Conference 2025.
