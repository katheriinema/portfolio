  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    My first experience using Godot and tinkering with game development outside of pygames. Found it very enjoyable, leading to my Pingoo Cafe game. Dodge the Creeps gave me a good introduction to the Godot Software and everything it had to offer, along with the GDScript language. The game is a simple 2D game where the player must dodge incoming enemies, and the goal is to survive as long as possible.
